Machine Learning Energy Efficiency

Data Mining Project regarding over 768 instances and 8 attributes. Compared Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and PCA models.

Data obtained from: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/energy+efficiency.

· Energy efficiency data set regarding building structures contained eight attributes and 768 instances
· Compared parametric methods (Logistic Regression, LDA) with non-parametric methods (Decision Tree, Random Forest) to determine the best model fit for predicting the heating and cooling loads 
· Determined the most energy efficient building structure

Random Forest model was the most interpretable and had best prediction rate.
